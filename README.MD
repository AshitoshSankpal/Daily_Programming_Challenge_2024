Day 1 of 30  Q1)

Problem: Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s
You are given an array arr consisting only of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The task is to sort the array in increasing order in linear time (i.e., O(n)) without using any extra space. This means you need to rearrange the array in-place.

Input :
An integer array arr of size n where each element is either 0, 1, or 2.
Example : arr = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]

Output :
The sorted array, arranged in increasing order of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
Example: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]

Day 2 of 30  Q.2)

Problem: Find the missing number
You are given an array arr containing n-1 distinct integers. The array consists of integers taken from the range 1 to n, meaning one integer is missing from this sequence. Your task is to find the missing integer.

Input :
An integer array arr of size n-1 where the elements are distinct and taken from the range 1 to n.
Example : arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]

Output :
Return the missing integer from the array.
Example: Missing Number : 3
